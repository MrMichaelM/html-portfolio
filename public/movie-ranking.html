<h1>The Best Movies According to Michael</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Great Escape</h3>
<p>This is my favorite heist type movie. <br />
Great cast and a fun escape plot!
</p>
<h3>Spritied Away</h3>
<p>Wonderful coming of age story with spectacular animation!

</p>
<h3>Wall-E</h3>
<p>The first thirty minutes of the film showcase the power of expression over words. <br />
Plus, it's the first place I heard La Vie en Rose, the song my wife I danced did our first dance too.</p>
